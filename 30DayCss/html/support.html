        <h3>Do you see a circle? Your browser is good.</h3>
        <p>Don't see a circle? The @supports property knows that, and didn't serve up that style for you.</p>
        <div class="circle">A circle.</div>

        <p>We CSS3 ninjas like to push the boundaries of web design, which means we get to dance on the bleeding edge of supported code. Unfortunately, everyday ordinary citizens and their old & outdated browser software may not be as "fresh" as us.</p>
        <p>Fear not, there's a CSS3 rule that recognizes the downfalls of the everyday ordinary browsing citizen, and rectifies the problem, leaving the user blissfully unaware of our epic-ness.</p>
        <h4>Enter the @supports rule</h4>
        <p>It's simple, really. Just use the @supports rule to to check a CSS <code>property: value</code> pair, like so...</p>
        <pre>
<code>
@supports (border-radius: 100px) {
.fresh {
  border-radius: 100px;
}
}
</code>
</pre>
        <p>If the browser understands, it will generate the style within the curly braces, otherwise, it'll move on... Like a chump.</p>
